# sortDrink

Instructions are for technique for drinking from standard cup, wine glass, or beaker that may improve biointegration of fluid and/or accompanying pills.

Note: Timings relate to elapsed since first swallow of step to next step's mouth open. After each step, keep mouth gently closed 4 seconds. Keep gentled closed for 5 seconds for final step.

1. Drink from cup as normal. Maybe 1.5 seconds of normal sipping. Wait 6-10 seconds.
2. Place cup on top of tongue and drink. Wait 2.5-3.5 seconds. Sips on top of tongue tend to self-meter and last around a second. 
3. Place pill on tongue, then place cup atop tongue and drink. Wait 5 seconds.
4. Place cup on top of tongue and drink. Wait 5 seconds.
5. Drink between teeth. Maybe 2 seconds of normal sipping. 


If taking a pill, the suggetion is to perform first with pill, then 3-5 minutes later without pill. Try to not eat or drink during these 3-5 minutes.

If chaining pills, the best pill-to-pill (final swallow to next mouth open) duration may be 9-14 seconds. 

If out of timing or otherwise wish to wait longer between pills, wait 3 minutes (first swallow of final step to mouth open for drink). Try to not eat or drink during these 3 minutes.
